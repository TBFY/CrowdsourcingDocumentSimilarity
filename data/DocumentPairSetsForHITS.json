The service provides equipment to meet the postural and mobility needs of all people who are eligible to receive NHS services within Kirklees and Calderdale.   This does predominately mean wheelchairs and specialist postural seating.   As part of the commissioning cycle the CCGs would like to gather information and opinions from experienced service providers to help us to develop the service and be prepared to deal with future demands.  In common with other parts of the country demand for posture and mobility equipment is growing due to an ageing population and increasing numbers of children with more complex needs.  As budgets are not increasing at the same rate we need to make the best use of the funding we have.  "

Just as with physical health there is a duty to make sure that young people who are struggling with their mental health have access to all the support and care that they need including within schools.   1. 2 A Government Teacher Voice survey in 2016 found that only just over half 57 of teachers said they felt equipped to identify behaviour that may be linked to a mental health issue and only 40 of teachers said they felt equipped to teach children in the classroom with mental health needs.   1. 3 That is why In January 2017 the Prime Minister committed to having mental health first aid awareness training available to all secondary schools aiming to have trained at least one teacher in every secondary school by 2020 to help spot the early symptoms of mental health issues and make sure that the child receives the support they need "

In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value.

Due to the high density nature of the equipment and uncertainties around timescales of the new Bay campus it was decided that a 3rd party datacentre was needed to accommodate it.  After evaluating several different options a new build water-cooled data centre at the Dylan Thomas Centre DTC was chosen as the best solution.  The work was undertaken by 2BM and completed in Dec 2012.  In 2018 Swansea University as part of the Super Computing Wales SCW project received an AtosDell supercomputer as a replacement for the original Fujitsu system.  SCW is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF through the Welsh Government.  This resulted in the decommissioning of the 12 racks of Fujitsu equipment by Swansea University staff and installation of 5 racks of  AtosDell equipment by Alces Software.  Layoutpower of the current equipment can be found in Appendices A and G.  The current active cabinets are labelled as cab 1256 and 7 in Appendix G.  Current power requirement of this system is just under 100 kW.  Due to the ownership of the Dylan Thomas Centre changing and several operating issues being identified it has been decided that Swansea University would like to relocate the Super Computing Wales equipment to the Bay Data centre.  Cooling at this datacentre is currently inadequate to house high density systems and will need to be upgraded.  Engineering are in the process of procuring a new super computer as part of the IMPACT operation that is part funded by ERDF through the Welsh Government.  The super computer are also high density systems that would need to be housed at the Bay data centre once the cooling is upgraded.  The system is expected to require 2 x cabinets fed by 6 x Single phase PDUs each with 7x C19 sockets.  Information Services and Systems ISS have 1 rack that needs to be moved to a high density rack.  This houses a Dell VX Rail system and can run at up to 12. 5 kW.   There are currently 4 x 32Amp PDUs each with 6 x C19 sockets.  Further information is available within the technical specification documents.  "

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.  We are looking for a supplier to manage the calibration and maintenance of the equipment described above.  We may also require some specialised calibration of our equipment which would be required to be outsourced to specific third party-calibration houses which we have relied on in the past.  Finally to keep ourselves up-to-date with the current technological advancements new kits are added to our repository that are compatible with the current measurement requirements.  "

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.  We are looking for a supplier to manage the calibration and maintenance of the equipment described above.  We may also require some specialised calibration of our equipment which would be required to be outsourced to specific third party-calibration houses which we have relied on in the past.  Finally to keep ourselves up-to-date with the current technological advancements new kits are added to our repository that are compatible with the current measurement requirements.  "

The service provides equipment to meet the postural and mobility needs of all people who are eligible to receive NHS services within Kirklees and Calderdale.   This does predominately mean wheelchairs and specialist postural seating.   As part of the commissioning cycle the CCGs would like to gather information and opinions from experienced service providers to help us to develop the service and be prepared to deal with future demands.  In common with other parts of the country demand for posture and mobility equipment is growing due to an ageing population and increasing numbers of children with more complex needs.  As budgets are not increasing at the same rate we need to make the best use of the funding we have.  "

The framework may be used by either the Council andor Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board ABMU HB to include but not be limited to either purchasing new supported living schemes or recommissioning existing supported living schemes including those schemes for people who may be considered as complex and challenging e. g.  schemes formally known as closer to home or for people in receipt of continuing healthcare CHC or have their care funded through a Section 117 arrangement.  Some people living in these schemes may have a primary or secondary mental health need.

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.  We are looking for a supplier to manage the calibration and maintenance of the equipment described above.  We may also require some specialised calibration of our equipment which would be required to be outsourced to specific third party-calibration houses which we have relied on in the past.  Finally to keep ourselves up-to-date with the current technological advancements new kits are added to our repository that are compatible with the current measurement requirements.  "

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.  We are looking for a supplier to manage the calibration and maintenance of the equipment described above.  We may also require some specialised calibration of our equipment which would be required to be outsourced to specific third party-calibration houses which we have relied on in the past.  Finally to keep ourselves up-to-date with the current technological advancements new kits are added to our repository that are compatible with the current measurement requirements.  "

In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value.

In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value.

Just as with physical health there is a duty to make sure that young people who are struggling with their mental health have access to all the support and care that they need including within schools.   1. 2 A Government Teacher Voice survey in 2016 found that only just over half 57 of teachers said they felt equipped to identify behaviour that may be linked to a mental health issue and only 40 of teachers said they felt equipped to teach children in the classroom with mental health needs.   1. 3 That is why In January 2017 the Prime Minister committed to having mental health first aid awareness training available to all secondary schools aiming to have trained at least one teacher in every secondary school by 2020 to help spot the early symptoms of mental health issues and make sure that the child receives the support they need "

                    "body": "BackgroundBuckinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group BCCG and Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group OCCG are planning to contract with Oxfordshire Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT for the supply of clinical continuing healthcare and continuing care services under a Single Tender Waiver STW. In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value.

In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value.

Due to the high density nature of the equipment and uncertainties around timescales of the new Bay campus it was decided that a 3rd party datacentre was needed to accommodate it.  After evaluating several different options a new build water-cooled data centre at the Dylan Thomas Centre DTC was chosen as the best solution.  The work was undertaken by 2BM and completed in Dec 2012.  In 2018 Swansea University as part of the Super Computing Wales SCW project received an AtosDell supercomputer as a replacement for the original Fujitsu system.  SCW is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF through the Welsh Government.  This resulted in the decommissioning of the 12 racks of Fujitsu equipment by Swansea University staff and installation of 5 racks of  AtosDell equipment by Alces Software.  Layoutpower of the current equipment can be found in Appendices A and G.  The current active cabinets are labelled as cab 1256 and 7 in Appendix G.  Current power requirement of this system is just under 100 kW.  Due to the ownership of the Dylan Thomas Centre changing and several operating issues being identified it has been decided that Swansea University would like to relocate the Super Computing Wales equipment to the Bay Data centre.  Cooling at this datacentre is currently inadequate to house high density systems and will need to be upgraded.  Engineering are in the process of procuring a new super computer as part of the IMPACT operation that is part funded by ERDF through the Welsh Government.  The super computer are also high density systems that would need to be housed at the Bay data centre once the cooling is upgraded.  The system is expected to require 2 x cabinets fed by 6 x Single phase PDUs each with 7x C19 sockets.  Information Services and Systems ISS have 1 rack that needs to be moved to a high density rack.  This houses a Dell VX Rail system and can run at up to 12. 5 kW.   There are currently 4 x 32Amp PDUs each with 6 x C19 sockets.  Further information is available within the technical specification documents.  "

Due to the high density nature of the equipment and uncertainties around timescales of the new Bay campus it was decided that a 3rd party datacentre was needed to accommodate it.  After evaluating several different options a new build water-cooled data centre at the Dylan Thomas Centre DTC was chosen as the best solution.  The work was undertaken by 2BM and completed in Dec 2012.  In 2018 Swansea University as part of the Super Computing Wales SCW project received an AtosDell supercomputer as a replacement for the original Fujitsu system.  SCW is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF through the Welsh Government.  This resulted in the decommissioning of the 12 racks of Fujitsu equipment by Swansea University staff and installation of 5 racks of  AtosDell equipment by Alces Software.  Layoutpower of the current equipment can be found in Appendices A and G.  The current active cabinets are labelled as cab 1256 and 7 in Appendix G.  Current power requirement of this system is just under 100 kW.  Due to the ownership of the Dylan Thomas Centre changing and several operating issues being identified it has been decided that Swansea University would like to relocate the Super Computing Wales equipment to the Bay Data centre.  Cooling at this datacentre is currently inadequate to house high density systems and will need to be upgraded.  Engineering are in the process of procuring a new super computer as part of the IMPACT operation that is part funded by ERDF through the Welsh Government.  The super computer are also high density systems that would need to be housed at the Bay data centre once the cooling is upgraded.  The system is expected to require 2 x cabinets fed by 6 x Single phase PDUs each with 7x C19 sockets.  Information Services and Systems ISS have 1 rack that needs to be moved to a high density rack.  This houses a Dell VX Rail system and can run at up to 12. 5 kW.   There are currently 4 x 32Amp PDUs each with 6 x C19 sockets.  Further information is available within the technical specification documents.  "

                    "body": "BackgroundBuckinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group BCCG and Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group OCCG are planning to contract with Oxfordshire Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT for the supply of clinical continuing healthcare and continuing care services under a Single Tender Waiver STW. In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value.

The service provides equipment to meet the postural and mobility needs of all people who are eligible to receive NHS services within Kirklees and Calderdale.   This does predominately mean wheelchairs and specialist postural seating.   As part of the commissioning cycle the CCGs would like to gather information and opinions from experienced service providers to help us to develop the service and be prepared to deal with future demands.  In common with other parts of the country demand for posture and mobility equipment is growing due to an ageing population and increasing numbers of children with more complex needs.  As budgets are not increasing at the same rate we need to make the best use of the funding we have.  "

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.  We are looking for a supplier to manage the calibration and maintenance of the equipment described above.  We may also require some specialised calibration of our equipment which would be required to be outsourced to specific third party-calibration houses which we have relied on in the past.  Finally to keep ourselves up-to-date with the current technological advancements new kits are added to our repository that are compatible with the current measurement requirements.  "

Due to the high density nature of the equipment and uncertainties around timescales of the new Bay campus it was decided that a 3rd party datacentre was needed to accommodate it.  After evaluating several different options a new build water-cooled data centre at the Dylan Thomas Centre DTC was chosen as the best solution.  The work was undertaken by 2BM and completed in Dec 2012.  In 2018 Swansea University as part of the Super Computing Wales SCW project received an AtosDell supercomputer as a replacement for the original Fujitsu system.  SCW is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF through the Welsh Government.  This resulted in the decommissioning of the 12 racks of Fujitsu equipment by Swansea University staff and installation of 5 racks of  AtosDell equipment by Alces Software.  Layoutpower of the current equipment can be found in Appendices A and G.  The current active cabinets are labelled as cab 1256 and 7 in Appendix G.  Current power requirement of this system is just under 100 kW.  Due to the ownership of the Dylan Thomas Centre changing and several operating issues being identified it has been decided that Swansea University would like to relocate the Super Computing Wales equipment to the Bay Data centre.  Cooling at this datacentre is currently inadequate to house high density systems and will need to be upgraded.  Engineering are in the process of procuring a new super computer as part of the IMPACT operation that is part funded by ERDF through the Welsh Government.  The super computer are also high density systems that would need to be housed at the Bay data centre once the cooling is upgraded.  The system is expected to require 2 x cabinets fed by 6 x Single phase PDUs each with 7x C19 sockets.  Information Services and Systems ISS have 1 rack that needs to be moved to a high density rack.  This houses a Dell VX Rail system and can run at up to 12. 5 kW.   There are currently 4 x 32Amp PDUs each with 6 x C19 sockets.  Further information is available within the technical specification documents.  "

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.  We are looking for a supplier to manage the calibration and maintenance of the equipment described above.  We may also require some specialised calibration of our equipment which would be required to be outsourced to specific third party-calibration houses which we have relied on in the past.  Finally to keep ourselves up-to-date with the current technological advancements new kits are added to our repository that are compatible with the current measurement requirements.  "

Due to the high density nature of the equipment and uncertainties around timescales of the new Bay campus it was decided that a 3rd party datacentre was needed to accommodate it.  After evaluating several different options a new build water-cooled data centre at the Dylan Thomas Centre DTC was chosen as the best solution.  The work was undertaken by 2BM and completed in Dec 2012.  In 2018 Swansea University as part of the Super Computing Wales SCW project received an AtosDell supercomputer as a replacement for the original Fujitsu system.  SCW is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF through the Welsh Government.  This resulted in the decommissioning of the 12 racks of Fujitsu equipment by Swansea University staff and installation of 5 racks of  AtosDell equipment by Alces Software.  Layoutpower of the current equipment can be found in Appendices A and G.  The current active cabinets are labelled as cab 1256 and 7 in Appendix G.  Current power requirement of this system is just under 100 kW.  Due to the ownership of the Dylan Thomas Centre changing and several operating issues being identified it has been decided that Swansea University would like to relocate the Super Computing Wales equipment to the Bay Data centre.  Cooling at this datacentre is currently inadequate to house high density systems and will need to be upgraded.  Engineering are in the process of procuring a new super computer as part of the IMPACT operation that is part funded by ERDF through the Welsh Government.  The super computer are also high density systems that would need to be housed at the Bay data centre once the cooling is upgraded.  The system is expected to require 2 x cabinets fed by 6 x Single phase PDUs each with 7x C19 sockets.  Information Services and Systems ISS have 1 rack that needs to be moved to a high density rack.  This houses a Dell VX Rail system and can run at up to 12. 5 kW.   There are currently 4 x 32Amp PDUs each with 6 x C19 sockets.  Further information is available within the technical specification documents.  "

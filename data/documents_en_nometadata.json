The service provides equipment to meet the postural and mobility needs of all people who are eligible to receive NHS services within Kirklees and Calderdale.   This does predominately mean wheelchairs and specialist postural seating.   As part of the commissioning cycle the CCGs would like to gather information and opinions from experienced service providers to help us to develop the service and be prepared to deal with future demands.  In common with other parts of the country demand for posture and mobility equipment is growing due to an ageing population and increasing numbers of children with more complex needs.  As budgets are not increasing at the same rate we need to make the best use of the funding we have.  "

We regulate the TV and radio sectors fixed line telecoms mobiles postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate.  We make sure that people in the UK get the best from their communications services and are protected from scams and sharp practices while ensuring that competition can thrive.  Ofcom operates under a number of Acts of Parliament including in particular the Communications Act 2003.  Ofcom must act within the powers and duties set for it by Parliament in legislation.  Ofcoms principal duty under the Communications Act is to further the interests of citizens and of consumers where appropriate by promoting competition.  Meeting this duty is at the heart of everything we do.  Accountable to Parliament we set and enforce regulatory rules for the sectors for which we have responsibility.  We also have powers to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority.  Overview Ofcom is responsible for managing civilian use of the radio spectrum.  Our work involves releasing spectrum for new uses as well as developing policies to ensure that the spectrum is used efficiently.  As the communications regulator we need to ensure that UK communications work for everyone and is of best interest to citizens and consumers.  To achieve this our engineers work on a varied range of projects that require critical and accurate measurements.  The equipment we use covers a wide range of frequencies and technologies.  We use this high-tech equipment in many varied environments from sensitive noise minimised screen rooms to mountain peaks during inclement weather conditions.  To maintain the level of accuracy in our work we make sure that our equipment are up-to-date with their calibration and repair.  However since we have a huge range of equipment our frequency of calibration is not the same for all.  Whilst many are calibrated regularly we also have assets that are only calibrated on demand by projects.  Ofcom works across the whole of the UK.  Our equipment is based out of 5 regional offices and we also have field engineers that are based from their homes.

Due to the high density nature of the equipment and uncertainties around timescales of the new Bay campus it was decided that a 3rd party datacentre was needed to accommodate it.  After evaluating several different options a new build water-cooled data centre at the Dylan Thomas Centre DTC was chosen as the best solution.  The work was undertaken by 2BM and completed in Dec 2012.  In 2018 Swansea University as part of the Super Computing Wales SCW project received an AtosDell supercomputer as a replacement for the original Fujitsu system.  SCW is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF through the Welsh Government.  This resulted in the decommissioning of the 12 racks of Fujitsu equipment by Swansea University staff and installation of 5 racks of  AtosDell equipment by Alces Software.  Layoutpower of the current equipment can be found in Appendices A and G.  The current active cabinets are labelled as cab 1256 and 7 in Appendix G.  Current power requirement of this system is just under 100 kW.  Due to the ownership of the Dylan Thomas Centre changing and several operating issues being identified it has been decided that Swansea University would like to relocate the Super Computing Wales equipment to the Bay Data centre.  Cooling at this datacentre is currently inadequate to house high density systems and will need to be upgraded.  Engineering are in the process of procuring a new super computer as part of the IMPACT operation that is part funded by ERDF through the Welsh Government.  The super computer are also high density systems that would need to be housed at the Bay data centre once the cooling is upgraded.  The system is expected to require 2 x cabinets fed by 6 x Single phase PDUs each with 7x C19 sockets.  Information Services and Systems ISS have 1 rack that needs to be moved to a high density rack.  This houses a Dell VX Rail system and can run at up to 12. 5 kW.   There are currently 4 x 32Amp PDUs each with 6 x C19 sockets.  Further information is available within the technical specification documents.  "

The Contracting Authority has 155 GWhannum of concessionary power that will included i the management.  From 1. 1. 2020 Klbu municipality will be merged with Trondheim municipality and its units will join this contract.  Klbu municipality's annual electricity consumption is approx.  6 GWhannum plus it has concessionary power for 205 GWhannum.   The delivery mainly comprises the following areas   physical delivery of electrical energy   handling and optimising concessionary power   implementation of a price insurance strategy and handling financial contracts   overview and prognoses for price development in the spot and forward market for electricity as well as important input factors for the production of for example water wind coal and gas   invoicing services and site administration   general consultancy services   reporting.   Trondheim municipality currently has a price insurance strategy which states an interval for a given percentage share of the expected consumption which is to be price insured with forward contracts.  The amount of the consumption that is to be price insured is decided by an interval for the price insurance model within different time horizons.  The Contracting Authority decides within these intervals that amount that is to be price insured based on the relationship between the average spot price in recent years and the price of forward contracts and judgemental assessments of the expected market development.  The Contracting Authority would like the chosen tenderer to be an opponent for all transactions and not a clearing customer at Nasdaq OMX.   The Contracting Authority can require consultancy services in the contract period that are in addition to the areas specified in this tender documentation.  If the tenderer is to demand compensation for any general consultancy services that are not mentioned in the tender documentation the frameworks for these consultancy services must be agreed in advance.  It is the tenderers responsibility to ensure that such an agreement is signed.  Tenderers are asked to specifiy hourly ratesthe fee model in their tender.   The signed contract will be based on the contracting authority having an obligation to meet their need for energy through the contract for the locations stated when the contract was signed.  It is highly probable that energy deliveries to additional locations will be phased in due to new developments and any rental of premises that does not include electricity.  Subsequently energy deliveries can also be phased out if for example locations are no longer used.   In the contract period the procurements cover all purchases within the product range covered by this contract and that are undertaken by Trondheim municipality with co-operating partners.  The Contracting Authority has based its specification of the services on the consumption from 2017.  "

        "text": "BackgroundBuckinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group BCCG and Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group OCCG are planning to contract with Oxfordshire Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT for the supply of clinical continuing healthcare and continuing care services under a Single Tender Waiver STW. In December 2017 NHS Aylesbury and Chiltern CCGs now BCCG commissioned an interim Adults Continuing Healthcare CHC and Childrens Continuing Care CC Service following early notice being received on an existing contract from the incumbent provider for the area of Buckinghamshire.  Due to the timeframes required it was determined that an interim provider needed to be appointed urgently to mobilise the services.  This was to guarantee continuity of services for patients adults children and young people across Buckinghamshire. OCCG have contracted with OHFT for their CHC and CC clinical assessment services for some years as part of a wider Community Services contractual arrangement. The interim arrangement in Bucks is due to finish on the 31. 3. 2019 and the community services contract in Oxfordshire is also due to end at this time.  A long term solution is now sought to encompass Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The VisionSince the interim solution in Buckinghamshire was agreed it has been announced by NHS England that Buckinghamshire will form part of an Integrated Care System.  Under the premise that Oxfordshire will also be part of an Integrated Care System in due course the vision is that the clinical CHC assessment services will be common to both Oxfordshire CCG OCCG and Buckinghamshire CCG BCCG and provided by OHFT.  OHFT currently provides these services to both CCGs but not in an integrated way.  We are looking for a delivery model across both Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire that delivers a transformative and future proofed model of CHC assessment and the purchasing of care packages that will maximise the advantages of a large scale long term service. The proposed contractThe optimum long-term solution is to draw on the strengths from across the Integrated Care System ICS.  This includes expertise in CHC from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust OHFT which already delivers CHC clinical assessment services to the population of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire expert knowledge of local hospital and community services and discharge pathways and an ability to recruit and retain nursing staff from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust BHT. This will be combined with knowledge of the local care home and domiciliary care market and procurement expertise and capacity available in Buckinghamshire County Council BCC in Oxfordshire work is underway to establish where this expertise is best placed.  Together these will simplify and speed up CHC processes and so improve the quality of the experience for patients.  This would not be possible with different service suppliers across these 2 counties. Given these strong existing relationships knowledge and experience OHFT were originally identified as the only reasonable option for delivering the service in 2017 in Buckinghamshire and have been the Contractor for Community Services including CHC and CC services in Oxfordshire for several years.  Building on the relationship and expertise that has developed since then BCCG and OCCG now wish to utilise these services to provide a long term solution for an initial period of 5 years from the 1. 4. 2019 with an option to extend for up to a further 5 years as part of developing the Buckinghamshire Integrated Care System.  The indicative value of the service is circa 3 200 000 GBP per annum which covers both counties. This approach enables integration of local services to release significant benefits to patients and is also expected to improve the use of public funding and therefore deliver best value. Please see VI. III Additional Information section for remaining text.  "

        "text": "The Agency for Urban Environment's aim is to ensure safety and quality and to ensure that the gift and profiling articles are environmentally friendly products.  Tenderers must therefore deliver products that are of high quality that tolerate use and wear as well as document the production and supplier chain.  Oslo Municipality has a design hand book that describes the different uses of the logo.  Rusken also has a design manual.  It is therefore important that the correct logo is approved before production. The scope of call-offs on the framework agreement is anticipated to be approx.  NOK 3 million per annum.
